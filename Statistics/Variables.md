# 📊 Statistics Lecture: Understanding Variables

## 🎯 Overview



In this session, we discussed the concept of **variables** in statistics and explored the different **types of variables** with simple definitions and real-life examples.

---

## 🔍 What is a Variable?

A **variable** is a **property that can take up any value**.

> Example:  
> - Age = 25  
> - Gender = Male  
> - Height = 5.9 ft

A variable holds **one value at a time**, and **a list of values is not a single variable**.

## 🧠 Types of Variables

Variables are mainly classified into:

### 1. Quantitative Variables  
Variables that represent **numerical values**.

#### 🔹 a. Discrete Variables
- Can take **only whole numbers** (no fractions or decimals).
- Examples:
  - Number of children
  - Number of bank accounts
  - Number of students in a class
  - Number of workers in a company

#### 🔹 b. Continuous Variables
- Can take **any value**, including **fractions/decimals**.
- Examples:
  - Height (e.g., 175.5 cm)
  - Weight (e.g., 72.3 kg)
  - Age (e.g., 25.5 years)

---

### 2. Qualitative (Categorical) Variables  
Variables that describe **categories** or **labels**, not numerical values.

- Examples:
  - Gender: Male, Female
  - Colors: Red, Green, Blue
  - States or Locations
