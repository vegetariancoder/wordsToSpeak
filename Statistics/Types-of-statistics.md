Statistics is generally divided into **two main types**:

---

## 1. 📝 Descriptive Statistics

**Descriptive statistics** involves techniques for **organizing and summarizing** data.

### ✨ Common Techniques:

- **Measures of Central Tendency**  
  - Mean  
  - Median  
  - Mode  

- **Measures of Dispersion**  
  - Variance  
  - Standard Deviation  

These techniques help to **summarize the sample** using numerical values.

> 📌 **Example**:  
> Suppose you collected the **heights of a sample of students**:  
> `180 cm, 170 cm, 162 cm, 150 cm, 160 cm`  
> You can use mean, median, or mode to summarize the **central tendency** of this height data.

## 2. 🧪 Inferential Statistics

**Inferential statistics** involves drawing **conclusions or inferences** about a **population** based on a **sample** of data.

### 🔍 Key Concepts:

- Collect a **sample dataset**
- Perform **experiments** like:
  - Z-test
  - T-test
  - Hypothesis testing
- Make **predictions or inferences** about the larger **population**

> 📌 **Example**:  
> - Population: A college with **1,000 students**  
> - Sample: A class of **statistics students**  
> - Using the sample's average height, infer the **average height** of the entire college

## 🆚 Descriptive vs Inferential Statistics

| Feature                | Descriptive Statistics              | Inferential Statistics                      |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Purpose                | Summarize sample data               | Make predictions about population           |
| Data Used              | Entire dataset or sample            | Sample only                                 |
| Techniques             | Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, etc. | Z-test, T-test, Hypothesis Testing, etc.    |
| Output                 | Tables, Graphs, Summary Stats       | Conclusions, Predictions                    |

## 🧠 Summary

- Descriptive = **What is** in the sample  
- Inferential = **What could be** in the population
