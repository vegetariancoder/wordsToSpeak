# ðŸŽ² Random Variables in Statistics

This lecture continues our journey into statistics by exploring **Random Variables**, an essential concept in data science, machine learning, and deep learning.

## ðŸ“Œ What is a Random Variable?

A **Random Variable** is:

> A function that derives its values from a **random process or experiment**.

It is usually denoted as **X** (capital letter).

---

## ðŸ§ª Examples to Understand Random Variables

### ðŸ”¹ Example 1: Equation  
Consider the equation:  
**y = 5x + 2**  
- Here, **x** can take different values (1, 2, 3...)  
- Accordingly, **y** will output different values  
- So, **x** behaves like a random variable in this case.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Example 2: Tossing a Coin  
- Process: Tossing a fair coin  
- Possible Outcomes: Head or Tail  
- Random Variable X can be assigned as:  
  - Head â†’ 0  
  - Tail â†’ 1  

This is a **discrete random variable**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Example 3: Rolling a Fair Dice  
- Process: Rolling a fair six-sided dice  
- Possible Outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6  
- Each outcome is a possible value of the **random variable X**  
- Again, this is a **discrete random variable**

---

### ðŸ”¹ Example 4: Measuring Rainfall  
- Process: Measure how many inches it will rain tomorrow  
- Possible Outcomes: 1.1 in, 5.5 in, 10.75 in, etc.  
- These values can be fractional or whole  
- This is a **continuous random variable**

---

### ðŸ”¹ Example 5: Heights of People  
- Process: Measure height of people attending an event  
- Possible Outcomes: 150 cm, 160.1 cm, etc.  
- Continuous values make this a **continuous random variable**

## ðŸ”„ Types of Random Variables

| Type                     | Description                                                 | Examples                         |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Discrete Random Variable** | Takes **specific values** (usually whole numbers)            | Coin toss, Dice roll             |
| **Continuous Random Variable** | Takes **any value** (including fractions) from a range       | Rainfall, Height, Temperature    |

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- A random variable is **not just any variable**; it is a **function derived from a process or experiment**.
- Discrete â†’ Fixed/countable values  
- Continuous â†’ Infinite/real values  
- Both types can be associated with **probability distributions**, which we'll explore in the next session.
