## 🧠 Key Concepts

### ✅ What is a Histogram?

A histogram is a graphical representation of the **distribution of numerical data**. It groups the data into **ranges (bins)** and shows how many values fall into each bin.

---
## 🔍 Histogram vs PDF

- A **histogram** is *discrete*, showing count per bin.
- A **Probability Density Function (PDF)** smoothens this into a continuous curve.
- To convert a histogram to a PDF, we use **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)**.

## 📈 What is KDE?

**Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)** is a technique to *smoothen* the histogram and estimate the **underlying probability distribution** of a dataset.
