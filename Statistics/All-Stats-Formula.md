# ðŸ“Š Statistics Formulas

Below are the most common statistics formulas with short explanations.

---

## 1. Mean (Average)
Formula:  
$$ \mu = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i}{N} $$
Explanation: Sum of all values divided by the total number of values. Measures the central tendency.

---

## 2. Median
Formula:  
Middle value when data is sorted.  
If even count:  
$$ \text{Median} = \frac{X_{\frac{n}{2}} + X_{\frac{n}{2}+1}}{2} $$
Explanation: The value that splits the dataset into two equal halves.

---

## 3. Mode
Formula:  
Most frequent value in the dataset.  
Explanation: Indicates the most common observation.

---

## 4. Variance
Formula:  
$$ \sigma^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (X_i - \mu)^2}{N} $$
Explanation: Average squared deviation from the mean. Measures spread.

---

## 5. Standard Deviation
Formula:  
$$ \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (X_i - \mu)^2}{N}} $$
Explanation: Square root of variance. Shows dispersion in same units as data.

---

## 6. Covariance
Formula:  
$$ \text{Cov}(X, Y) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{N} $$
Explanation: Measures the directional relationship between two variables.

---

## 7. Correlation (Pearson)
Formula:  
$$ r = \frac{\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y} $$
Explanation: Normalized covariance. Values between -1 and 1 show strength & direction of linear relationship.

---

## 8. Probability
Formula:  
$$ P(E) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} $$
Explanation: Likelihood of an event occurring.

---

## 9. Z-Score
Formula:  
$$ Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} $$
Explanation: Number of standard deviations a value is from the mean.

---

## 10. Skewness
Formula:  
$$ \text{Skewness} = \frac{\frac{1}{N} \sum (X_i - \mu)^3}{\sigma^3} $$
Explanation: Measures asymmetry of the distribution.

---

## 11. Kurtosis
Formula:  
$$ \text{Kurtosis} = \frac{\frac{1}{N} \sum (X_i - \mu)^4}{\sigma^4} $$
Explanation: Measures peakedness of the distribution.
