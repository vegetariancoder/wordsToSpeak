### Important Notes on Table Types in Snowflake:
#### Permanent Table:

- Default table type. 
- Includes full Time Travel and Fail Safe capabilities. 
- Suitable for production environments where strong data protection is required. 
- Drawback: Higher storage costs due to additional data protection features.

#### Transient Table:

- Created using CREATE TRANSIENT TABLE.
- Supports Time Travel but no Fail Safe.
- Suitable for large datasets that donâ€™t require stringent data protection.
- Lower storage costs compared to permanent tables.
- Data persists across sessions until explicitly dropped.
#### Temporary Table:

- Created using CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE.
- Supports Time Travel but no Fail Safe.
- Data exists only within the current session and is automatically deleted when the session ends.
- Suitable for testing, development, or non-permanent data.

#### Key Differences Between Transient and Temporary Tables:

- Transient Table: Data persists across sessions until explicitly dropped.
- Temporary Table: Data is deleted automatically when the session ends.

#### Use Cases:

- Permanent Tables: For critical production data requiring robust protection.
- Transient Tables: For large datasets or development environments where less protection is acceptable.
- Temporary Tables: For testing or non-permanent data that only needs to exist during a session.

#### Additional Notes:

- Temporary and transient options are also available for other database objects (e.g., schemas, databases).
- Temporary tables with the same name as permanent tables in a session will hide the permanent table.
- The choice of table type helps optimize storage costs and manage data protection requirements.
