### Important Notes on Zero-Copy Cloning in Snowflake:
#### 1. Overview of Cloning:

- Cloning allows the duplication of database objects (tables, schemas, databases, etc.) using a single command.
- The syntax: CREATE TABLE <new_table> CLONE <source_table>.
- Supports cloning of:
Databases, schemas, tables, streams, file formats, sequences, stages, tasks, and pipes.
- Exceptions: Named internal stages and pipes referencing non-external stages cannot be cloned.
#### 2.How Zero-Copy Cloning Works:

- Cloning is a metadata operation, not a data copy.
- The new object references the same micro-partitions as the original, minimizing storage costs.
- At the time of cloning, a snapshot of the original object is taken.
- Modifications to the clone or the original object are independent and create new micro-partitions as needed.
#### 3.Advantages of Zero-Copy Cloning:

- Efficient Storage: Only the additional modifications consume storage.
- Speed: The process is quick as it operates at the metadata level.
- Use Cases:
  - Testing scenarios without impacting production data. 
  - Creating backups. 
  - Experimenting with time travel data.

#### 4.Privileges and Permissions:

- Cloning requires specific privileges:
  - Tables: SELECT privilege.
  - Pipes, Streams, Tasks: OWNERSHIP privilege.
  - Other Objects: USAGE privilege.
- Child Object Privileges:
  - When cloning databases or schemas, child objects inherit privileges.
  - The parent (database or schema) does not inherit privileges and requires manual configuration.
