### Steps to build a conceptual model.
1. Identify business objects
   - In this step we find out what are the business entities and objects.
   - Which object is used for which approach.
2. Establish relationship between objects
   - In this step we figure the relationship between each object/entity.
   - In this step we define what entity is based on other entity.
3. Determine cardinality (**Cardinality : relationships between the data in two database tables.** )
   - In this step we check for how many things are related to each other.
   - We define - one to one, one to many or many to many
