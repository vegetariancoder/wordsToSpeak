## 📨 Producer

- A **Producer** is an application that sends data (messages) to Kafka.
- Messages are just arrays of bytes to Kafka.
- Examples:
  - Sending each line of a file as a message.
  - Posting each row of a database query as individual messages.
- You can create a custom producer or use built-in connectors.

---

## 📥 Consumer

- A **Consumer** is an application that reads data from Kafka.
- Consumers do **not** receive messages directly from producers.
- They pull data from the Kafka **broker** by requesting it.
- A consumer processes messages and can ask for more in a loop.
- Can perform further processing, alerting, aggregation, etc.

---

## 🧭 Broker

- A **Broker** is a Kafka server that stores and forwards messages.
- It acts as a **middleman** between producers and consumers.
- All communication happens through the broker.

---

## 🖥️ Cluster

- A **Kafka Cluster** is a group of broker nodes working together.
- Each node runs an instance of the Kafka broker.
- Ensures scalability and fault tolerance.

---

## 🗂️ Topic

- A **Topic** is a named stream of data (like a database table).
- Producers send data to a topic; consumers read from it.
- Topics help in logically organizing data streams.
- Example Topics:
  - `current-load-topic`
  - `consumed-units-topic`
  - `input-fluctuations-topic`

---

## 📦 Partition

- A **Partition** is a smaller, manageable chunk of a topic.
- Used for:
  - Storage distribution across nodes.
  - Parallel data processing.
- Each partition is stored on one broker and can't be split further.
- Number of partitions is a **design-time decision**.

---

## 🔢 Offset

- An **Offset** is a unique ID assigned to each message in a partition.
- Starts from `0` and increases sequentially.
- Offsets are local to each partition (not globally ordered).
- Used to track and retrieve specific messages.

---

## 👥 Consumer Group

- A **Consumer Group** is a group of consumers collaborating to read from a topic.
- Each partition is read by only **one consumer** in a group (no overlap).
- Ensures parallel consumption and workload distribution.
- Maximum number of consumers = number of partitions.

## 🧪 Real-World Example: Retail Chain

1. Every store's billing system is a **producer**, sending invoices as messages.
2. Kafka topic (e.g., `invoices-topic`) is **partitioned** and spread across brokers in a **cluster**.
3. A **consumer** at the data center reads messages and writes to a database.
4. To handle high volume, use a **consumer group** with multiple consumers.
5. Each consumer handles one or more partitions, enabling scalable, parallel processing.

|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Producer        | Sends data (messages) to Kafka                                |
| Consumer        | Receives data from Kafka                                      |
| Broker          | Kafka server; routes messages between producer and consumer   |
| Cluster         | Group of Kafka brokers                                        |
| Topic           | Named stream of data/messages                                 |
| Partition       | Sub-division of a topic for scalability and parallelism       |
| Offset          | Unique ID for each message in a partition                     |
| Consumer Group  | Multiple consumers working together to process topic data     |

> ⚠️ Remember: Partitions are key to Kafka’s **scalability and distribution**. Designing your topic-partition structure is crucial for efficient Kafka usage.
