## <u>What is Normalization</u>

♦ Normalization is a **database design technique** that helps to **reduce down the redundancy (repetitiveness)** from the data.

♦ Normalization helps to **minimize the data update, delete and modify related anomalies**.

♦ Normalization basically **divides the larger table into smaller tables** and **linked them using a relationship**.
