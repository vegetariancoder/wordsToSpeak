## <u>What is Normalization</u>

♦ Normalization is a **database design technique** that helps to **reduce down the redundancy (repetitiveness)** from the data.

♦ Normalization helps to **minimize the data update, delete and modify related anomalies**.

♦ Normalization basically **divides the larger table into smaller tables** and **linked them using a relationship**.

Here is the list of Normal Forms :

1. **1 NF (First Normal Form)**
2. **2 NF (Second Normal Form)**
3. **3 NF (Third Normal Form)**
4. **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)**
5. **4 NF (Fourth Normal Form)**
6. **5 NF (Fifth Normal Form)**

**☀️ Rules for 1 NF**

- Each table cells should contain only single value.
- Each record needs to be unique.
